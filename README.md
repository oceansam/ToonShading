My Unity Shader Experiments.

I was inspired to learn shaders as I looked back at the art style of Zelda: Wind Waker. I gained interest in the art style and wanted to look into ways to develop water shaders. This propelled me to just experiment around with shaders and create whatever came to my mind. So.. enjoy?
